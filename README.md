# **Summary**

This dataset contains the appointments from 3 months in 2016. Based on this analysis I will be able to analyse what drives patients to show up for their appointments


# **Conclusions**



* From initial explorations, it looks like there might be some correlations that require deeper dives and inferential statistical analyses to get a better idea on the population
* It looks like having one or more comorbidites is associated with higher showup rates. Patients with hypertension have higher showup rates while patients with alcoholism have the lowest showup rates
* Show-up rate decreased by about 11% when patients recieved and SMS prior to their appointments
* Show-up rate decreased by about 4% in patients who have scholarships


# **Limitations:**



* Some values don't make sense in practical like having -1 for Age, which affects the quality of the analysis
* It's not sufficient to decide on existing correlations from just scatterplots, further hypothesis testing will be needed
